As a beginner, I have made a very simple SSM framework project for beginners to learn the SSM framework. The project function is mainly to complete the data interaction at the front and back ends,Including adding, deleting, modifying and querying the database. The project has detailed notes and instructions. Beginners themselves can also quickly complete an SSM framework project. It can be used to learn spring, spring MVC, mybatis, maven, JS, HTML, CSS and other related knowledge.The project is divided into four stages. Beginners can learn and do the project step by step.
